pocket text 30cm 2 sided Bow T Square.FCStd
-------------------------------------------
Contains an archery bow T square. The numeric scale may be printed in an alternate color by changing filament color one third through the print then changing back to the original color when the middle solid layers are complete. In the provided stl file, pause at layer 6 and change the filament, then pause at layer 10 and restore the original filament. If a T square longer than 24cm is needed print two biscuits and the 30 cm extension and glue the parts. *Waning changing the scale factors in the slicer will result in an inaccurate T square.*
