## Linear Shaft Support

Precision stand up linear shaft support. Bore 8[mm].

### SK08, SKXX

Now with the 0.20 version is possible to use a `Configuration table`  to create multiple variants of the same model. In the `SKXX.FCStd` file you will find the SK08, SK10, SK12, SK13, SK16, SK20, SK25, SK30, SK35, SK40, SK50, SK60 models (configurations) in the same file. Learn more about the [Configuration tables here](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Spreadsheet_Workbench#Configuration_tables).

## Bearings

These bearing are usually used in assemblies with 2020 profiles. You can find more specialized bearing in the `Mechanical Parts/Bearings` folder.

### LM8UU

Now with the 0.20 version is possible to use a `Configuration table`  to create multiple variants of the same model. In the `LMXXXUU.FCStd` file you will find the LM6UU, LM6LUU, LM8SUU, LM8UU, LM8LUU, LM10UU, LM10LUU, LM12LUU, LM13LUU, LM16LUU, LM20LUU, LM25LUU, LM30LUU, LM35LUU, LM40LUU, LM50LUU and LM60LUU models (configurations) in the same file.

## Leadscrews

Some leadscrew related parts.

### Tr8x8 leadscrew

* Thread: Tr8x8
* Starts: 4
* Lead: 8mm

The first 8 of Tr8 means it is to indicate the *diameter* (8mm) and the second 8 means the *lead*.
8mm lead means when drive by a stepper driver in *Full Step mode*, it moves 8mm per revolution.
